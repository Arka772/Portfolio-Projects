# Portfolio Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a **Data Analyst** skilled in **Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau**, and **Power BI**, with expertise in transforming data into actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making. This repository showcases my projects in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Each project highlights key tools and methodologies used, including machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and interactive dashboards. My focus is on delivering insights that lead to better business outcomes.

## Projects

### 1. [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](./Airline%20Passenger%20Satisfaction)
   - **Skills**: Advanced Excel, Data Visualization  
   - **Summary**: Analyzed customer satisfaction data to identify key drivers of satisfaction. Recommendations were made to improve service quality, focusing on enhancing seat comfort and in-flight service.

### 2. [Book Store Sales Performance Dashboard](./Book%20Store%20Sales%20Performance%20Dashboard)
   - **Skills**: Tableau, Data Visualization, Sales Analysis  
   - **Summary**: Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze book sales, marketing ROI, and inventory turnover. The project identified high-performing genres and authors, helping optimize inventory and marketing spend.

### 3. [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Arka772/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Car%20Price%20Prediction)
- **Skills Used**: Python, Machine Learning, Regression Analysis  
- **Summary**: This project explores car price prediction using machine learning techniques. Various algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, were tested. After comprehensive data analysis, feature selection, and model tuning, the **AdaBoostRegressor** demonstrated the best performance:
  - **R2 Value**: 0.9852
  - **Mean Accuracy on Test Data**: 87.63%
  - **Median Accuracy on Test Data**: 91.22%
  - **Final Average Accuracy**: 84.74%  
  The **AdaBoostRegressor** used a **DecisionTreeRegressor** as the base estimator with `max_depth=5`, `learning_rate=0.04`, and `n_estimators=100`. For efficiency, the model was trained using the top three impactful features, optimizing both accuracy and computational resources.

### 4. [Customer Churn Prediction](./Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)
   - **Skills**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis  
   - **Summary**: The project aimed to predict customer churn for a European bank using machine learning. Key steps included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical feature selection. Three models were developed: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 82%, with balanced precision and recall, making it the best-performing model. Key predictors of churn were NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember, and Balance. Visualizations like the confusion matrix and ROC curve confirmed the model's robustness, with an AUC of 0.84. The final model can help the bank identify at-risk customers for targeted retention efforts.

### 5. [Iris Dataset Classification](./Iris%20Dataset%20Classification)
   - **Skills**: Python, Classification, Data Analysis  
   - **Summary**: Applied classification models like Random Forest to predict Iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. Achieved 98% accuracy using cross-validation and confusion matrix for model evaluation.

### 6. [Mexican Toy Sales Analysis](./Mexican%20Toy%20Sales%20Analysis)
   - **Skills**: Tableau, Data Analysis, Visualization  
   - **Summary**: Analyzed sales and inventory data for a fictitious toy store chain. The dashboard provided insights into sales trends and inventory levels, enabling better stock management and marketing strategies.

### 7. [NYPD Arrests Analysis](./NYPD%20Arrests%20Analysis)
   - **Skills**: SQL, Data Analysis  
   - **Summary**: Analyzed arrest data from NYPD to identify trends in demographics, crime locations, and timings. The findings highlighted areas for resource allocation and potential policy improvements.
### 8. [VBA Automation for Splitting Data into Different Sheets by Region](./VBA%20Automation%20for%20Splitting%20Data)
   - **Skills**: VBA, Excel Automation
   - **Summary**: Created a VBA macro to automate the process of splitting data into separate sheets based on region with a single click. This project helps streamline data organization and reporting by automatically segregating data into region-specific sheets.
